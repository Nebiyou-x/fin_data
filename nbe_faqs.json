    "output": "We set rules for how banks should be run financially. These rules ensure banks have enough capital (money or other wealth such as property or shares) and the right plans and structures in place.\nWe monitor banks to ensure they follow our policy. We do this by keeping in contact with bank staff at all levels so we can keep an eye on things like their accounts and the way they work. We call this work ‘supervision’.\nIf a bank does get into difficulty, we work with it to ensure that firms have orderly wind-down plans in place.\nUsing regulation and supervision, we try to make sure that banks are run properly, and that if a bank fails it doesn’t cause widespread problems in the economy.",
